My project will be depicting a food desert, where I will try and inform people about this issue and what they can do to help. A food desert is a place that is far away from any fresh produce and grocery stores. It is so important to have access to healthy and fresh food because artificial food increases chances of heart disease, poor nutrition, and other health issues. My visual argument will be focusing on visual punning, as a food desert isn't actually a desert full of food. I'm trying to play on these words to raise awareness of the issue. I try to include elements like contrast by having the bare yellow background, and then having the pieces of junk food and the cactus to draw attention to those two things. Then, I make sure the cactus is in the middle of the image to create balance, as the cactus is leaning each way equally.
